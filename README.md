SnakesInAClassroom
==================

An Android game of Snake, developed in a Java/Android workshop.

It's a pretty basic game of snake, which was built piece-by-piece to show off both some OO concepts
and primitive Android graphics.

I may have gone somewhat overboard with componentization and separation of concerns...
